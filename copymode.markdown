## Copy Mode

*since: latest nightly*

Copy mode allows you to make selections using the keyboard; no need to reach
for your mouse or trackpad.

The `ActivateCopyMode` key assignment is used to enter copy mode; it is
bound to `CTRL-SHIFT-X` by default.

When copy mode is activated, the title is prefixed with "Copy Mode" and
the behavior of the tab is changed; keyboard input now controls the
cursor and allows moving it through the scrollback, scrolling the viewport
as needed, in a style similar to that of the Vim editor.

Move the cursor to the start of the region you wish to select and press `v` to
toggle selection mode (it is off by default), then move the cursor to the end
of that region.  You can then use `Copy` (by default: `CTRl-SHIFT-C`) to copy
that region to the clipboard.
